## Features

- **Automatic Commit Every 30 Minutes**: The extension automatically commits changes every 30 minutes to ensure that your work is regularly logged on main branch so that your git contribution is counted.
- **Sync Logs in Main Branch**: All your sync logs are stored in the `main` branch, ensuring that your contributions are tracked, even if you're working on a different branch.
- **Keeps Track of Your Hard Work**: By syncing your changes to the main branch, your contributions are always counted in the repository history, providing visibility of your continuous progress.
- **Works on Any Branch**: No need to worry about not being on the main branch. `gitClock` ensures your work is recorded regardless of the branch you're working on.
- **Customizable Commit Messages**: The commit messages are automatically generated to reflect the time and sync details, making your commit history clean and organized.
- **Lightweight and Simple**: The extension works quietly in the background without interrupting your workflow, only committing changes when necessary.
